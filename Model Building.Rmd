##Design Matrix and splitting the Data

```{r}
designMatrix <-
  train_dockets %>% select(nmotionsfiled,
  pro_se,
  rateSettle,
  rateSummJudg,
  issue_joined,
  rateDenied, 
  pretrial_conf
  ) %>%
  as.data.table() %>% one_hot() %>% as.matrix()
  
  labelSettled <-
  train_dockets %>% select(settled) %>% mutate(settled = ifelse(settled == TRUE, 1, 0)) %>% as.matrix()
  labelSummJudg <-
  train_dockets %>% select(summary_judgment) %>% mutate(summary_judgment = ifelse(summary_judgment == TRUE, 1, 0)) %>% as.matrix()

  
  n <- 100
  data <- data.frame(x = runif(n), y = rnorm(n))
  ind <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE),
  n,
  replace = TRUE,
  prob = c(0.75, 0.25))
  dataTrainSettled <- designMatrix[ind,]
  dataTestSettled <- designMatrix[!ind,]
  
  labelTrainSettled <- labelSettled[ind, ]
  labelTestSettled <- labelSettled[!ind, ]
  
  dataTrainSummJudg <- designMatrix[ind,]
  dataTestSummJudg <- designMatrix[!ind,]
  
  labelTrainSummJudg <- labelSummJudg[ind, ]
  labelTestSummJudg <- labelSummJudg[!ind, ]
```


##Now, the fun XGBoost stuff

```{r}
trainDataSettled <-
  xgb.DMatrix(dataTrainSettled, label = labelTrainSettled)
  testDataSettled <-
  xgb.DMatrix(dataTestSettled, label = labelTestSettled)
  bstSettled <-
  xgboost(
  data = trainDataSettled,
  nround = 20,
  early_stopping_rounds = 3,
  objective = "binary:logistic", 
  gamma = 1
  )
  predSettled <- predict(bstSettled, testDataSettled)
  predOutcomeSettled <- ifelse(predSettled > 0.5, 1, 0)
```

```{r}
  confusionMatrix(as.factor(predOutcomeSettled), as.factor(labelTestSettled))
  importance_matrix <- xgb.importance(model = bstSettled)
  print(importance_matrix)
  xgb.plot.importance(importance_matrix = importance_matrix)
```

```{r}
trainDataSummJudg <-
  xgb.DMatrix(dataTrainSummJudg, label = labelTrainSummJudg)
  testDataSummJudg <-
  xgb.DMatrix(dataTestSummJudg, label = labelTestSummJudg)
  bstSummJudg <-
  xgboost(
  data = trainDataSummJudg,
  objective = "binary:logistic",
  nround = 20,
  early_stopping_rounds = 3, 
  gamma = 1
  )
  predSummJudg <- predict(bstSummJudg, testDataSummJudg)
  predOutcomeSummJudg <- as.factor(ifelse(predSummJudg > 0.5, 1, 0))
```

```{r}
  confusionMatrix(as.factor(predOutcomeSummJudg), as.factor(labelTestSummJudg))
  importance_matrix <- xgb.importance(model = bstSummJudg)
  print(importance_matrix)
  xgb.plot.importance(importance_matrix = importance_matrix)
```

##Pointlessly elaborate way to do the combined confusion matrix. But hey, it works, and it's a hack-a-thon so it's not like we're getting points for having the most elegant code. 

```{r}
mean(rowSums(cbind(
  ifelse(
  predOutcomeSettled == labelTestSettled &
  predOutcomeSettled == 1,
  1,
  0
  ),
  ifelse(
  predOutcomeSettled == labelTestSettled &
  predOutcomeSettled == 0,
  1,
  0
  ),
  ifelse(
  predOutcomeSummJudg == labelTestSummJudg &
  predOutcomeSummJudg == 1,
  1,
  0
  ),
  ifelse(
  predOutcomeSummJudg == labelTestSummJudg &
  predOutcomeSummJudg == 1,
  1,
  0
  )
  )))
```

```{r}
xgb.plot.multi.trees(feature_names = names(diseaseInfo_matrix), 
                     model = model)
```
