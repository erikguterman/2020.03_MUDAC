Consider separate models for Motion for Summary Judgement and Motion to Dismiss

Reading in the data. All columns not specified use ReadR's default. 

Many values specified as characters will be later converted to factors, if needed. (Additionally, the MUDAC_ID column is left as a CHAR across all datasets for simpler joining.)


```{r}
train_dockets <- read_csv(
  "train_dockets.csv",
  col_types = cols(
  circuit = col_character(),
  district = col_character(),
  diversity_residence = col_character(),
  filers_county = col_character(),
  jurisdiction = col_character(),
  mudac_id = col_character(),
  nos_code = col_character(),
  office = col_character(),
  origin_at_filing = col_character(),
  pro_se = col_character(),
  settled = col_logical(),
  summary_judgment = col_logical()
  )
  )

train_other_motions <-
  read_csv("train_other_motions.csv",
  col_types = cols(mudac_id = col_character()))
  
train_terminating_motions <-
  read_csv("train_terminating_motions.csv",
