#Merging Datasets

```{r}
##The dataset we're working with is small enough that we'll be fine merging these together

merged_district_with_fips <-
  left_join(district_fips_code, districts, by = c("district_number", "state")) %>% 
  rename(census_2010_district_population = census_2010_population)

##Also, going to merge this information into the main one just to make it easier for humans to read.  
train_dockets <- left_join(train_dockets, districts, by = c("district" = "district_number"))
```

#Cleaning and transforming data

```{r}
##There are very few cases with any pro se clients, and therefore all will be combined into one in order to improve the availability
train_dockets <- train_dockets %>% 
  mutate(pro_se = ifelse(pro_se == 0, 0, 1))
```

##Exploratory Analysis

```{r}
ggplot(train_dockets, aes(x = year_filed)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, colour="black", fill="indianred4")

ggplot(train_dockets,
       aes(x = year_filed,
       fill = outcome)) +
       geom_bar(position = "fill") 

##it might be worth considering a filter for 2020 if we include a year factor in the final model due to the very low number of cases for 2020
##a difference visible in the distribution of outcomes

ggplot(train_dockets, 
       aes(x = district, fill = circuit)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "stack")

summary(glm(summary_judgment ~ circuit, data = train_dockets, family = binomial()))
summary(glm(settled ~ circuit, data = train_dockets, family = binomial()))

##In short, circuit does matter when computing the outcome. 

ggplot(train_dockets, 
       aes(x = nos_code, fill = circuit)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

##The huge spike is the Illinois Northern district, which services the city of Chicago 
##Similarly, the second highest is the Eastern Michigan district, representing Detroit, and so on for other large cities

##Ask Barbara what to do with this extreme imbalance
##Anova(lm(train_dockets$nos_code ~ train_dockets$circuit), type = 2)

summary(glm(summary_judgment ~ requested_damages_amt, data = train_dockets, family = binomial()))
summary(glm(settled ~ requested_damages_amt, data = train_dockets, family = binomial()))
##Requested damages isn't a significant predictor of a summary judgement, but increasing it does lead to an increased likelihood of settling.

summary(glm(summary_judgment ~ pro_se, data = train_dockets, family = binomial()))
summary(glm(settled ~ pro_se, data = train_dockets, family = binomial()))
##Filing pro se is a significant predictor of likelihood of both. 

summary(glm(summary_judgment ~ days_opened, data = train_dockets, family = binomial()))
summary(glm(settled ~ days_opened, data = train_dockets, family = binomial()))
##The data may be unbalanced due to the fact that length of trial has a significant effect on outcome, and cases that will last longer that started recently will not have finished yet.
